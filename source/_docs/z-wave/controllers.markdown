## Supported Z-Wave USB Sticks & Hardware Modules

You need to have a compatible Z-Wave stick or module installed. The following devices have been confirmed to work with Z-Wave JS:

<div class='note warning'>

Until recently, 700 series Z-Wave Controllers had a bug that could cause the mesh to be flooded on some networks and the controller to become unresponsive. At present, all 700 series controllers share the same firmware and are subject to this bug. It appears that this bug is largely, if not completely, resolved as of firmware version 7.17.2.

Users should upgrade the firmware on all 700 series controllers to version 7.17.2 or greater. Firmware can be upgraded using the below directions:

- [Upgrade instructions using Linux](https://github.com/kpine/zwave-js-server-docker/wiki/700-series-Controller-Firmware-Updates-(Linux))
- [Upgrade instructions using Windows (Aeotec)](https://aeotec.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/6000252296-update-z-stick-7-with-windows)
- [Upgrade instructions using Windows (Zooz)](https://www.support.getzooz.com/kb/article/931-how-to-perform-an-ota-firmware-update-on-your-zst10-700-z-wave-stick/)
- [Upgrade instructions using Windows/Linux (Z-Wave.Me)](https://z-wave.me/support/uzbrazberry-firmwares/)

If you are just starting out, we recommend that you purchase a 500 series controller.

<div class='note'>
  If you're using Home Assistant OS, Supervised, or Container, it's recommended to use a USB stick, not a module. Passing a module through Docker is more complicated than passing a USB stick through.

## Stick Alternatives

The alternative to a stick is a hub that supports Z-Wave. Home Assistant supports the following hubs with Z-Wave support:

- [Vera](/integrations/vera/)
- [Fibaro](/integrations/fibaro/)
- [SmartThings](/integrations/smartthings/)
- [Z-Wave.Me Z-Way](/integrations/zwave_me)

## Controller Notes

### Aeotec Z-Stick

<div class='note'>

There are [known compatibility issues](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=245031#p1502030) with older hardware versions of the Aeotec stick not working on the Raspberry Pi 4. Aeotec has released a 2020 hardware revision ZW090-A/B/C Gen5+ with Pi 4 compatibility. Both hardware revisions are still being sold, make informed purchasing decisions if using paired with a Pi 4.

</div>

It's totally normal for your Z-Wave stick to cycle through its LEDs (Yellow, Blue and Red) while plugged into your system.

### Razberry Board

You need to disable the on-board Bluetooth since the board requires the use of the hardware UART (and there's only one on the Pi3). You do this by adding the following to the end of `/boot/config.txt`:

For both processes below you will need to insert your SD card into your PC and open the `/boot/config.txt` file with your favorite text editor.

#### Raspberry Pi 4 procedure

Add the following parameters to the bottom of the `/boot/config.txt` file.

```text
dtoverlay=disable-bt
enable_uart=1
```

Reboot your Pi 4 without the Razberry Z-Wave hat first. Then shutdown, add the hat back, and boot again.

#### Raspberry Pi 3 procedure

Add the following parameters to the bottom of the `/boot/config.txt` file.

```text
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

Reboot your Pi 3.

For Home Assistant OS this should be everything you need to do. You should now be able to use Razberry Z-Wave from `/dev/ttyAMA0`.

For other operating systems such as Raspberry Pi OS you will also have to run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable hciuart
```

You should also check the README for details on the overlays. You might find it in `/boot/overlays/README` on your SD-card. If it is not there you can find [the official version here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README).

<div class='note'>

  It is possible to keep a limited Bluetooth functionality while using Razberry Z-Wave. Check `boot/overlays/README` on `miniuart-bt`.

</div>

<div class='note'>

  `disable-bt` was previously known as `pi3-disable-bt`. If your OS is old, you might need to use this instead.

</div>

<div class='note'>

  If you've installed the Z-Way software, you'll need to ensure you disable it before you install Home Assistant or you won't be able to access the board. Do this with `sudo /etc/init.d/z-way-server stop; sudo update-rc.d z-way-server disable`.
